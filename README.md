## GUI
![](https://github.com/AlyNasr/Castle-War-Game-Simulation/blob/main/simulation.gif)  
Four towers are defending the castle against enemies. Each tower guards one region (A, B, C or D) and can shoot only enemies in its region.  
Each region has a paved distance, colored "Khaki" in the above GUI, where enemies are allowed to move towards the tower only in the paved distance.  

There are 3 types of enemies:  
1. Pavers: Blue color, they are responsible for paving more distance towards the towers.  
2. Fighters: Green color, they attack the tower of their region causing damage that affects the tower health.  
3. Shielded Fighters: Orange color, they also attack the tower of their region but cause double the damage caused by the normal fighters. 
 
A tower also attacks the enemies of its region causing damage that affects their health. The shielded fighters are affected less than pavers and normal fighters.
